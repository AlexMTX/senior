# Python Questions for Senior and Lead roles

## Ways to execute Python code: exec, eval, ast, code, codeop, etc.

The `exec(object, globals, locals)` method executes the dynamically created program, which is either a string or a code object. Returns `None`. Only side effect matters!

Example 1:
```python
program = 'a = 5\nb=10\nprint("Sum =", a+b)'
exec(program)
```
```bash
Sum = 15
```

Example 2:
```python
globals_parameter = {'__builtins__' : None}
locals_parameter = {'print': print, 'dir': dir}
exec('print(dir())', globals_parameter, locals_parameter)
```
```bash
['dir', 'print']
```

The `eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)` method parses the expression passed to this method and runs python expression (code) within the program. Returns the value of expression!

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> eval('37 + a')   # it is an expression
42
>>> exec('37 + a')   # it is an expression statement; value is ignored (None is returned)
>>> exec('a = 47')   # modify a global variable as a side effect
>>> a
47
>>> eval('a = 47')  # you cannot evaluate a statement
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 1
    a = 47
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

If a `code` object (which contains Python bytecode) is passed to `exec` or `eval`, they behave identically, excepting for the fact that exec ignores the return value, still returning `None` always. So it is possible use `eval` to execute something that has statements, if you just compiled it into bytecode before instead of passing it as a string:
```python
>>> eval(compile('if 1: print("Hello")', '<string>', 'exec'))
Hello
>>>
```

`Abstract Syntax Trees`, ASTs, are a powerful feature of Python. You can write programs that inspect and modify Python code, after the syntax has been parsed, but before it gets compiled to byte code. That opens up a world of possibilities for introspection, testing, and mischief.

In addition to compiling source code to bytecode, `compile` supports compiling abstract syntax trees (parse trees of Python code) into `code` objects; and source code into abstract syntax trees (the `ast.parse` is written in Python and just calls `compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST))`; these are used for example for modifying source code on the fly, and also for dynamic code creation, as it is often easier to handle the code as a tree of nodes instead of lines of text in complex cases.

The `code` module provides facilities to implement read-eval-print loops in Python. Two classes and convenience functions are included which can be used to build applications which provide an **interactive interpreter prompt**.

The `codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-print loop can be emulated, as is done in the `code` module. As a result, you probably don‚Äôt want to use the module directly; if you want to include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the code module instead.

## Advanced differences  between 2.x and 3.x in general

### Division operator
If we are porting our code or executing python 3.x code in python 2.x, it can be dangerous if integer division changes go unnoticed (since it doesn‚Äôt raise any error). It is preferred to use the floating value (like 7.0/5 or 7/5.0) to get the expected result when porting our code. 
### `print` function
This is the most well-known change. In this, the print keyword in Python 2.x is replaced by the print() function in Python 3.x. However, parentheses work in Python 2 if space is added after the print keyword because the interpreter evaluates it as an expression. 
### Unicode
In Python 2, an implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3.x implicit str type is Unicode. 

### `xrange`
xrange() of Python 2.x doesn‚Äôt exist in Python 3.x. In Python 2.x, range returns a list i.e. range(3) returns [0, 1, 2] while xrange returns a xrange object i. e., xrange(3) returns iterator object which works similar to Java iterator and generates number when needed. 

### Error Handling
There is a small change in error handling in both versions. In python 3.x, ‚Äòas‚Äô keyword is required. 

### `_future_` module
The idea of the __future__ module is to help migrate to Python 3.x. 
If we are planning to have Python 3.x support in our 2.x code, we can use _future_ imports in our code. 

### Six
Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. It provides utility functions for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions. See the documentation for more information on what is provided.

## `deepcopy`, method `copy`, slicing, etc.
In the above code, the copy() returns a shallow copy of list and deepcopy() return a deep copy of list.
Python `slice()` function returns a slice object. 

A sequence of objects of any type(`string`, `bytes`, `tuple`, `list` or `range`) or the object which implements `__getitem__()` and `__len__()` method then this object can be sliced using `slice()` method.

## OrderedDict, DefaultDict
An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that:

`OrderedDict` preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. A regular dict doesn‚Äôt track the insertion order and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. By contrast, the order the items are inserted is remembered by OrderedDict.

`Defaultdict` is a container like dictionaries present in the module collections. `Defaultdict` is a sub-class of the dictionary class that returns a dictionary-like object. The functionality of both dictionaries and defaultdict are almost same except for the fact that defaultdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does not exists.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def def_value():
    return "Not Present"

d = defaultdict(def_value)
```

## `hashable()`

An object is hashable if it has a hash value that does not change during its entire lifetime. Python has a built-in hash method ( `__hash__()` ) that can be compared to other objects. For comparing it needs `__eq__()` or `__cmp__()` method and if the hashable objects are equal then they have the same hash value. All immutable built-in objects in Python are hashable like tuples while the mutable containers like lists and dictionaries are not hashable. 

`lambda` and user functions are hashable.

Objects hashed using `hash()` are irreversible, leading to loss of information.
`hash()` returns hashed value only for immutable objects, hence can be used as an indicator to check for mutable/immutable objects.

## Strong and weak typing

Python is strongly, dynamically typed.

* **Strong** typing means that the type of value doesn't change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn't magically become a number, as may happen in Perl. Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.
* **Dynamic** typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, as opposed to static typing where variables have a type.

```python
bob = 1
bob = "bob"
```

This works because the variable does not have a type; it can name any object. After `bob = 1`, you'll find that `type(bob)` returns `int`, but after `bob = "bob"`, it returns `str`.

##Frozenset
The `frozenset()` function returns an immutable frozenset object initialized with elements from the given iterable.

Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python `set` object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Due to this, frozen sets can be used as keys in Dictionary or as elements of another set. But like sets, it is not ordered (the elements can be set at any index).

## Weak references
Python contains the ``weakref`` module that creates a weak reference to an object. If there are no strong references to an object, the garbage collector is free to use the memory for other purposes.

Weak references are used to implement caches and mappings that contain massive data.

## Raw strings

Python raw string is created by prefixing a string literal with ‚Äòr‚Äô or ‚ÄòR‚Äô. Python raw string treats backslash (\) as a literal character. This is useful when we want to have a string that contains backslash and don‚Äôt want it to be treated as an escape character.


## Unicode and ASCII strings	

Unicode is international standard where a mapping of individual characters and a unique number is maintained. As of May 2019, the most recent version of Unicode is 12.1 which contains over 137k characters including different scripts including English, Hindi, Chinese and Japanese, as well as emojis. These 137k characters are each represented by a unicode code point. So unicode code points refer to actual characters that are displayed.
These code points are encoded to bytes and decoded from bytes back to code points. Examples: Unicode code point for alphabet a is U+0061, emoji üñê is U+1F590, and for Œ© is U+03A9.

The main takeaways in Python are:
1. Python 2 uses str type to store bytes and unicode type to store unicode code points. All strings by default are `str` type ‚Äî which is bytes~ And Default encoding is ASCII. So if an incoming file is Cyrillic characters, Python 2 might fail because ASCII will not be able to handle those Cyrillic Characters. In this case, we need to remember to use decode("utf-8") during reading of files. This is inconvenient.
2. Python 3 came and fixed this. Strings are still `str` type by default but they now mean unicode code points instead ‚Äî we carry what we see. If we want to store these `str` type strings in files we use bytes type instead. Default encoding is UTF-8 instead of ASCII. Perfect!

# Python Statements and Syntax

## Iteration protocol.

Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.

## Generators
Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable you can only iterate over once. Generators do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly

## yield
`yield` is a keyword that is used like `return`, except the function will return a generator.
To master `yield`, you must understand that when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run. The function only returns the generator object, this is a bit tricky.

## method send(), throw(), next(), close()

`send()` - sends value to generator, send(None) must be invoked at generator init.

```python
def double_number(number):
    while True:
        number *= 2
        number = yield number
```

`throw()` - throw custom exception. Useful for databases:

```python
def add_to_database(connection_string):
    db = mydatabaselibrary.connect(connection_string)
    cursor = db.cursor()
    try:
        while True:
            try:
                row = yield
                cursor.execute('INSERT INTO mytable VALUES(?, ?, ?)', row)
            except CommitException:
                cursor.execute('COMMIT')
            except AbortException:
                cursor.execute('ABORT')
    finally:
        cursor.execute('ABORT')
        db.close()
```

## Coroutines
Coroutines declared with the `async`/`await` syntax is the preferred way of writing asyncio applications. For example, the following snippet of code (requires Python 3.7+) prints ‚Äúhello‚Äù, waits 1 second, and then prints ‚Äúworld‚Äù:
```python
>>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
```

# Functions in Python	

## When and how many times are default arguments evaluated?

Once when program is launched

## `partial`

`functools.partial(func, /, *args, **keywords)`

Return a new partial object which when called will behave like func called with the positional arguments args and keyword arguments keywords. If more arguments are supplied to the call, they are appended to args. If additional keyword arguments are supplied, they extend and override keywords.

## Best practice decorators for functions

The basic idea is to use a function, but return a partial object of itself if it is called with parameters before being used as a decorator:

```python
from functools import wraps, partial

def decorator(func=None, parameter1=None, parameter2=None):

   if not func:
        # The only drawback is that for functions there is no thing
        # like "self" - we have to rely on the decorator 
        # function name on the module namespace
        return partial(decorator, parameter1=parameter1, parameter2=parameter2)
   @wraps(func)
   def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Decorator code-  parameter1, etc... can be used 
        # freely here
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
   return wrapper
```
And that is it - decorators written using this pattern can decorate a function right away without being "called" first:
```python
@decorator
def my_func():
    pass
```
Or customized with parameters:

```python
@decorator(parameter1="example.com", ...):
def my_func():
    pass
```

## Decorator

```python
import functools

def require_authorization(f):
    @functools.wraps(f)
    def decorated(user, *args, **kwargs):
        if not is_authorized(user):
            raise UserIsNotAuthorized
        return f(user, *args, **kwargs)
    return decorated

@require_authorization
def check_email(user, etc):
    # etc.
```

## Decorator factory (passing args to decorators)

```python
def require_authorization(action):
    def decorate(f):
        @functools.wraps(f):
        def decorated(user, *args, **kwargs):
            if not is_allowed_to(user, action):
                raise UserIsNotAuthorized(action, user)
            return f(user, *args, **kwargs)
        return decorated
    return decorate
```

## `wraps`

Preserves original name of the function

## Decorator for class
1. Just use inheritance
2. Use decorator, that returns class
```python
def addID(original_class):
    orig_init = original_class.__init__
    # Make copy of original __init__, so we can call it without recursion

    def __init__(self, id, *args, **kws):
        self.__id = id
        self.getId = getId
        orig_init(self, *args, **kws) # Call the original __init__

    original_class.__init__ = __init__ # Set the class' __init__ to the new one
    return original_class

@addID
class Foo:
    pass
```
3. Use metaclass

Indeed, metaclasses are especially useful to do black magic, and therefore complicated stuff. But by themselves, they are simple:

* intercept a class creation
* modify the class
* return the modified class

```python
>>> class Foo(object):
...       bar = True

>>> Foo = type('Foo', (), {'bar':True})

class UpperAttrMetaclass(type):
    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, attrs):
        uppercase_attrs = {
            attr if attr.startswith("__") else attr.upper(): v
            for attr, v in attrs.items()
        }
        return type(clsname, bases, uppercase_attrs)
```

The main use case for a metaclass is creating an API. A typical example of this is the Django ORM.

## Indirect function calls
1) use another variable for this function
2) use `partial`
3) use as parameter `def indirect(func, *args)`
4) use nested func and return it (functional approach)
5) `eval("func_name()")` -> returns func result
6) `exec("func_name()")` -> returns None
7) importing module (assuming module foo with method bar):
```python
module = __import__('foo')
func = getattr(module, 'bar')
func()
```
8) `locals()["myfunction"]()`
9) `globals()["myfunction"]()`
10) dict()
```python
functions = {'myfoo': foo.bar}

mystring = 'myfoo'
if mystring in functions:
    functions[mystring]()
```

## Function introspection

Introspection is an ability to determine the type of an object at runtime. Everything in python is an object. Every object in Python may have attributes and methods. By using introspection, we can dynamically examine python objects. Code Introspection is used for examining the classes, methods, objects, modules, keywords and get information about them so that we can utilize it. Introspection reveals useful information about your program‚Äôs objects. 

- `type()`: This function returns the type of an object.
- `dir()`: This function return list of methods and attributes associated with that object.
- `id()`: This function returns a special id of an object.
- `help()`	It is used it to find what other functions do
- `hasattr()`	Checks if an object has an attribute
- `getattr()`	Returns the contents of an attribute if there are some.
- `repr()`	Return string representation of object
- `callable()`	Checks if an object is a callable object (a function)or not.
- `issubclass()`	Checks if a specific class is a derived class of another class.
- `isinstance()`	Checks if an objects is an instance of a specific class.
- `sys()`	Give access to system specific variables and functions
- `__doc__`	Return some documentation about an object
- `__name__`	Return the name of the object.

## Implementation details of functional programming, for vs map
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which the primary method of computation is evaluation of pure functions. Although Python is not primarily a functional language, it‚Äôs good to be familiar with `lambda`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` because they can help you write concise, high-level, parallelizable code. You‚Äôll also see them in code that others have written.

```python
list(
     map(
         (lambda a, b, c: a + b + c),
         [1, 2, 3],
         [10, 20, 30],
         [100, 200, 300]
     )
)
list(filter(lambda s: s.isupper(), ["cat", "Cat", "CAT", "dog", "Dog", "DOG", "emu", "Emu", "EMU"]))
reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 100)  # (100 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5), 100 is initial value
```


##Function attributes
```python
def func():
    pass
dir(func)
    Out[3]: 
    ['__annotations__',
     '__call__',
    ...
     '__str__',
     '__subclasshook__']
func.a = 1
dir(func)
    Out[5]: 
    ['__annotations__',
     '__call__',
    ...
     '__str__',
     '__subclasshook__',
     'a']
print(func.__dict__)
{'a': 1}
func.__getattribute__("a")
    Out[7]: 1
```

# Scopes in Python	
## LEGB rule

Python resolves names using the so-called LEGB rule, which is named after the Python scope for names. The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what these terms mean:

1. Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It‚Äôs created at function call, not at function definition, so you‚Äôll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.

2. Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

3. Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code. `dir()`

4. Built-in scope is a special Python scope that‚Äôs created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It‚Äôs automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script. `dir(__builtins__)`: 152 names

The LEGB rule is a kind of name lookup procedure, which determines the order in which Python looks up names. For example, if you reference a given name, then Python will look that name up sequentially in the local, enclosing, global, and built-in scope. If the name exists, then you‚Äôll get the first occurrence of it. Otherwise, you‚Äôll get an error.

When you call `dir()` with no arguments, you get the list of names available in your main global Python scope. Note that if you assign a new name (like var here) at the top level of the module (which is `__main__` here), then that name will be added to the list returned by `dir()`.

## `global` and `nonlocal`

### The `global` Statement

The statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. You can also use multiple global statements with a name (or a list of names). All the names that you list in a global statement will be mapped to the global or module scope in which you define them.

### The `nonlocal` Statement
Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. If you want to modify them, then you need to use a nonlocal statement. With a nonlocal statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal.

The nonlocal statement consists of the nonlocal keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. These names will refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope. 

## Scopes and nested functions, closures

This technique by which some data (hello in this case) gets attached to the code is called closure in Python.

```python
def print_msg(msg):
    # This is the outer enclosing function
    def printer():
        # This is the nested function
        print(msg)
    return printer  # returns the nested function

# Now let's try calling this function.
another = print_msg("Hello")
another()
# Output: Hello
```

The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are summarized in the following points.

- We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
- The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
- The enclosing function must return the nested function.

Python Decorators make an extensive use of closures as well.

## globals() –∏ locals(): Meaning, could we change both of them?	

- `globals()` always returns the dictionary of the module namespace
- `locals()` always returns a dictionary of the current namespace
- `vars()` returns either a dictionary of the current namespace (if called with no argument) or the dictionary of the argument.

It does not automatically update when variables are assigned, and assigning entries in the dict will not assign the corresponding local variables.

# Modules in Python		

## Module `reload`, `importlib`

Reload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. This is useful if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter. The return value is the module object (which can be different if re-importing causes a different object to be placed in sys.modules).

```python
from importlib import reload  # Python 3.4+
import foo

while True:
    # Do some things.
    if is_changed(foo):
        foo = reload(foo)
```

# OOP in Python	
## abstract base class

They make sure that derived classes implement methods and properties dictated in the abstract base class.
Abstract base classes separate the interface from the implementation. They define generic methods and properties that must be used in subclasses. Implementation is handled by the concrete subclasses where we can create objects that can handle tasks.
They help to avoid bugs and make the class hierarchies easier to maintain by providing a strict recipe to follow for creating subclasses.

```python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class AbstactClassCSV(metaclass = ABCMeta):  # or just inherits from ABC, helper class
    def __init__(self, path, file_name):
       self._path = path
       self._file_name = file_name
        
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def path(self):
       pass  
```

## getattr(), setattr()

`hasattr(object, name)` function:

Determines whether an object has a name attribute or a name method, returns a bool value, returns True with a name attribute, or returns False.

`getattr(object, name[,default])` function:

Gets the property or method of the object, prints it if it exists, or prints the default value if it does not exist, which is optional.

`setattr(object, name, values)` function:

Assign a value to an object's property. If the property does not exist, create it before assigning it.

## `__getattr__`, `__setattr__`, `__delattr__`

```python
>>> # this example uses __setattr__ to dynamically change attribute value to uppercase
>>> class Frob:
...     def __setattr__(self, name, value):
...         self.__dict__[name] = value.upper()
...
>>> f = Frob()
>>> f.bamf = "bamf"
>>> f.bamf
'BAMF'
```

Note that if the attribute is found through the normal mechanism, `__getattr__()` is not called. (This is an intentional asymmetry between `__getattr__()` and `__setattr__()`.) This is done both for efficiency reasons and because otherwise `__getattr__()` would have no way to access other attributes of the instance.

```python
>>> class Frob:
...     def __init__(self, bamf):
...         self.bamf = bamf
...     def __getattr__(self, name):
...         return 'Frob does not have `{}` attribute.'.format(str(name))
...
>>> f = Frob("bamf")
>>> f.bar
'Frob does not have `bar` attribute.'
>>> f.bamf
'bamf'
```


## `__getattribute__`

If the class also defines `__getattr__()`, the latter will not be called unless `__getattribute__()` either calls it explicitly or raises an AttributeError.

```python
>>> class Frob(object):
...     def __getattribute__(self, name):
...         print "getting `{}`".format(str(name))
...         object.__getattribute__(self, name)
...
>>> f = Frob()
>>> f.bamf = 10
>>> f.bamf
getting `bamf`
```

## Name mangling

In name mangling process any identifier with two leading underscore and one trailing underscore is textually replaced with `_classname__identifier` where classname is the name of the current class. It means that any identifier of the form `__geek` (at least two leading underscores or at most one trailing underscore) is replaced with `_classname__geek`, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
  
s1 = Student("Santhosh")
print(s1._Student__name)
```

## @property(getter, setter, deleter)

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        print('Getting name')
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        print('Setting name to ' + value)
        self._name = value

    @name.deleter
    def name(self):
        print('Deleting name')
        del self._name

p = Person('Adam')
print('The name is:', p.name)
p.name = 'John'
del p.name
```

## init,  repr, str, cmp,  new , del,  hash, nonzero, unicode, class operators

- `__init__` The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created.
- `repr()` The repr() function returns a printable representation of the given object.
- The `__str__` method in Python represents the class objects as a string ‚Äì it can be used for classes. The __str__ method should be defined in a way that is easy to read and outputs all the members of the class. This method is also used as a debugging tool when the members of a class need to be checked.
- `__cmp__` is no longer used.
- `__mew__` Whenever a class is instantiated `__new__` and `__init__` methods are called. `__new__` method will be called when an object is created and `__init__` method will be called to initialize the object.
```python
class A(object):
    def __new__(cls):
         print("Creating instance")
         return super(A, cls).__new__(cls)
  
    def __init__(self):
        print("Init is called")
```
Output:

- Creating instance
- Init is called

- `__del__` The `__del__()` method is a known as a destructor method in Python. It is called when all references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected. Note : A reference to objects is also deleted when the object goes out of reference or when the program ends
- `__hash__()`
```python
class A(object):

    def __init__(self, a, b, c):
        self._a = a
        self._b = b
        self._c = c

    def __eq__(self, othr):
        return (isinstance(othr, type(self))
                and (self._a, self._b, self._c) ==
                    (othr._a, othr._b, othr._c))

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self._a, self._b, self._c))
```

## Rich comparison methods

`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, `__ge__`, `__eq__`, and `__ne__`

```python
def __lt__(self, other):
   ...
def __le__(self, other):
   ...
def __gt__(self, other):
   ...
def __ge__(self, other):
   ...
def __eq__(self, other):
   ...
def __ne__(self, other):
   ...
```

## `__call__`

`object()` is shorthand for `object.__call__()`

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Instance Created")
  
    # Defining __call__ method
    def __call__(self, a, b):
        print(a * b)
  
# Instance created
ans = Product()
  
# __call__ method will be called
ans(10, 20)
```

## Multiple inheritance

Python has known at least three different MRO algorithms: classic, Python 2.2 new-style, and Python 2.3 new-style (a.k.a. C3). Only the latter survives in Python 3.

## Classic algorithm

Classic classes used a simple MRO scheme: when looking up a method, base classes were searched using a simple depth-first left-to-right scheme. The first matching object found during this search would be returned. For example, consider these classes:
```python
class A:
  def save(self): pass

class B(A): pass

class C:
  def save(self): pass

class D(B, C): pass
```
If we created an instance x of class D, the classic method resolution order would order the classes as D, B, A, C. Thus, a search for the method x.save() would produce A.save() (and not C.save()). 

## Diamond problem

One problem concerns method lookup under "diamond inheritance." For example:
```python
class A:
  def save(self): pass

class B(A): pass

class C(A):
  def save(self): pass

class D(B, C): pass
```
Here, class D inherits from B and C, both of which inherit from class A. Using the classic MRO, methods would be found by searching the classes in the order D, B, A, C, A. Thus, a reference to x.save() will call A.save() as before. However, this is unlikely what you want in this case! Since both B and C inherit from A, one can argue that the redefined method C.save() is actually the method that you want to call, since it can be viewed as being "more specialized" than the method in A (in fact, it probably calls A.save() anyways). For instance, if the save() method is being used to save the state of an object, not calling C.save() would break the program since the state of C would be ignored.

Although this kind of multiple inheritance was rare in existing code, new-style classes would make it commonplace. This is because all new-style classes were defined by inheriting from a base class object. Thus, any use of multiple inheritance in new-style classes would always create the diamond relationship described above. For example:
````python
class B(object): pass

class C(object):
  def __setattr__(self, name, value): pass

class D(B, C): pass
````

Moreover, since object defined a number of methods that are sometimes extended by subtypes (e.g., __setattr__()), the resolution order becomes critical. For example, in the above code, the method C.__setattr__ should apply to instances of class D.

To fix the method resolution order for new-style classes in Python 2.2, G. adopted a scheme where the MRO would be pre-computed when a class was defined and stored as an attribute of each class object. The computation of the MRO was officially documented as using a depth-first left-to-right traversal of the classes as before. If any class was duplicated in this search, all but the last occurrence would be deleted from the MRO list. So, for our earlier example, the search order would be D, B, C, A (as opposed to D, B, A, C, A with classic classes).

In reality, the computation of the MRO was more complex than this. Guido discovered a few cases where this new MRO algorithm didn't seem to work. Thus, there was a special case to deal with a situation when two bases classes occurred in a different order in the inheritance list of two different derived classes, and both of those classes are inherited by yet another class. For example:
```python
class A(object): pass
class B(object): pass
class X(A, B): pass
class Y(B, A): pass
class Z(X, Y): pass
```
Using the tentative new MRO algorithm, the MRO for these classes would be Z, X, Y, B, A, object. (Here 'object' is the universal base class.) However, I didn't like the fact that B and A were in reversed order. Thus, the real MRO would interchange their order to produce Z, X, Y, A, B, object.


## MRO, super

Thus, in Python 2.3, we abandoned my home-grown 2.2 MRO algorithm in favor of the academically vetted C3 algorithm. One outcome of this is that Python will now reject any inheritance hierarchy that has an inconsistent ordering of base classes. For instance, in the previous example, there is an ordering conflict between class X and Y. For class X, there is a rule that says class A should be checked before class B. However, for class Y, the rule says that class B should be checked before A. In isolation, this discrepancy is fine, but if X and Y are ever combined together in the same inheritance hierarchy for another class (such as in the definition of class Z), that class will be rejected by the C3 algorithm. This, of course, matches the Zen of Python's "errors should never pass silently" rule.

**In Python, the MRO is from bottom to top and left to right. This means that, first, the method is searched in the class of the object. If it‚Äôs not found, it is searched in the immediate super class. In the case of multiple super classes, it is searched left to right, in the order by which was declared by the developer. For example:**

## Mixins

A mixin is a special kind of multiple inheritance. There are two main situations where mixins are used:

- You want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
- You want to use one particular feature in a lot of different classes.

## metaclass definition

Metaclasses are the 'stuff' that creates classes.

You define classes in order to create objects, right?

But we learned that Python classes are objects.

Well, metaclasses are what create these objects. They are the classes' classes, you can picture them this way:

```python
MyClass = MetaClass()
my_object = MyClass()

# You've seen that type lets you do something like this:

MyClass = type('MyClass', (), {})
```
## type(), isinstance(), issubclass()

###`type()` Parameters
The `type()` function either takes a single object parameter.

Or, it takes 3 parameters

`name` - a class name; becomes the `__name__` attribute
`bases` - a tuple that itemizes the base class; becomes the `__bases__` attribute
`dict` - a dictionary which is the namespace containing definitions for the class body; becomes the `__dict__` attribute

### `type()` Return Value
The `type()` function returns

type of the object, if only one object parameter is passed
a new type, if 3 parameters passed

The isinstance() function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type, otherwise False.

If the type parameter is a tuple, this function will return True if the object is one of the types in the tuple.

The issubclass() function checks if the class argument (first argument) is a subclass of classinfo class (second argument).

The syntax of issubclass() is:

`issubclass(class, classinfo)`

## `__slots__`	

The special attribute `__slots__` allows you to explicitly state which instance attributes you expect your object instances to have, with the expected results:

- faster attribute access.
- space savings in memory.

The space savings is from Storing value references in slots instead of __dict__.

Denying `__dict__` and `__weakref__` creation if parent classes deny them and you declare `__slots__`.
Quick Caveats

```python
class Base:
    __slots__ = 'foo', 'bar'

class Right(Base):
    __slots__ = 'baz', 
```

# Troubleshooting in Python	
## Types of profilers: Static and dynamic profilers

Serious software development calls for performance optimization. When you start optimizing application performance, you can‚Äôt escape looking at profilers. Whether monitoring production servers or tracking frequency and duration of method calls, profilers run the gamut

### `trace` module

You can do several things with trace:

1. Produce a code coverage report to see which lines are run or skipped over (`python3 -m trace ‚Äìcount trace_example/main.py`).
2. Report on the relationships between functions that call one other (`python3 -m trace ‚Äìlistfuncs trace_example/main.py | grep -v importlib`).
3. Track which function is the caller (`python3 -m trace ‚Äìlistfuncs ‚Äìtrackcalls trace_example/main.py | grep -v importlib`).

### `faulthandler` module

By contrast, faulthandler has slightly better Python documentation. It states that its purpose is to dump Python tracebacks explicitly on a fault, after a timeout, or on a user signal. It also works well with other system fault handlers like Apport or the Windows fault handler. Both the faulthandler and trace modules provide more tracing abilities and can help you debug your Python code. For more profiling statistics, see the next section.

If you‚Äôre a beginner to tracing, I recommend you start simple with trace.

### application performance monitoring (APM) tools that fit

### What part of the code should I profile?
Now let‚Äôs delve into profiling specifics. The term ‚Äúprofiling‚Äù is mainly used for performance testing, and the purpose of performance testing is to find bottlenecks by doing deep analysis. So you can use tracing tools to help you with profiling. Recall that tracing is when software developers log information about a software execution. Therefore, logging performance metrics is also a way to perform profiling analysis.

But we‚Äôre not restricted to tracing. As profiling gains mindshare in the mainstream, we now have tools that perform profiling directly. Now the question is, what parts of the software do we profile (measure its performance metrics)?

### Typically, we profile:

- Method or function (most common)
- Lines (similar to method profiling, but doing it line by line)
- Memory (memory usage)

### What metrics should I profile?

- Speed (time)
- Calls (frequency)
- Method and line profiling

Both cProfile and profile are modules available in the Python 3 language. The numbers produced by these modules can be formatted into reports via the pstats module.

Here‚Äôs an example of cProfile showing the numbers for a script:
```python
import cProfile
import re

cProfile.run('re.compile("foo|bar")')

197 function calls (192 primitive calls) in 0.002 seconds
```

### Memory profiling
Another common component to profile is the memory usage. The purpose is to find memory leaks and optimize the memory usage in your Python programs. In terms of generic Python options, the most recommended tools for memory profiling for Python 3 are the `pympler` and the `objgraph` libraries.

```python
>>> from pympler import classtracker
>>> tr = classtracker.ClassTracker()
>>> tr.track_class(Document)
>>> tr.create_snapshot()
>>> create_documents()
>>> tr.create_snapshot()
>>> tr.stats.print_summary()
active 1.42 MB average pct
Document 1000 195.38 KB 200 B 13%
```

### Deterministic profiling versus statistical profiling
When we do profiling, it means we need to monitor the execution. That in itself may affect the underlying software being monitored. Either we monitor all the function calls and exception events, or we use random sampling and deduce the numbers. The former is known as deterministic profiling, and the latter is statistical profiling. Of course, each method has its pros and cons. Deterministic profiling can be highly precise, but its extra overhead may affect its accuracy. Statistical profiling has less overhead in comparison, with the drawback being lower precision.

cProfile, which I covered earlier, uses deterministic profiling. Let‚Äôs look at another open source Python profiler that uses statistical profiling: pyinstrument.

### `pyinstrument`
Pyinstrument differentiates itself from other typical profilers in two ways. First, it emphasizes that it uses statistical profiling instead of deterministic profiling. It argues that while deterministic profiling can give you more precision than statistical profiling, the extra precision requires more overhead. The extra overhead may affect the accuracy and lead to optimizing the wrong part of the program. Specifically, it states that using deterministic profiling means that ‚Äúcode that makes a lot of Python function calls invokes the profiler a lot, making it slower.‚Äù This is how results get distorted and the wrong part of the program gets optimized.

## `resource` module	

This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling system resources utilized by a program.

Symbolic constants are used to specify particular system resources and to request usage information about either the current process or its children.

`resource.getrusage(who)`
This function returns an object that describes the resources consumed by either the current process or its children, as specified by the who parameter. The who parameter should be specified using one of the RUSAGE_* constants described below.

A simple example:
```python
from resource import *
import time

# a non CPU-bound task
time.sleep(3)
print(getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF))

# a CPU-bound task
for i in range(10 ** 8):
   _ = 1 + 1
print(getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF))
```
