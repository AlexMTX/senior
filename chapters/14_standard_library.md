# Python standard library

https://docs.python.org/3/library/

Just read their names and short descriptions at least. You would be surprised how many task you can do with pure python.

## Advanced knowledge of standard library

- `math` This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C
  standard. https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
- `random` This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various
  distributions. https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
- `re`  This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in
  Perl. https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
- `sys` This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that
  interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available. https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
- `os` This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read
  or write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the
  lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see
  the tempfile module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil
  module. https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
- `time`,
- `datetime`,
- `argparse` Parser for command-line options, arguments and sub-commands https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
- `optparse` Deprecated since version 3.2: The optparse module is deprecated and will not be developed further;
  development will continue with the argparse module.
